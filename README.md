# AWQMSdata  


AWQMSdata was created to load data from Oregon DEQ AWQMS into R. This is intended for internal Oregon DEQ users. Public users should use the AWQMS frontend locacted  [here.](https://www.oregon.gov/deq/wq/Pages/WQdata.aspx)   

There is a Shiny App that can be used to help put together the data retrieval function. You can clone or download that app [here.](https://github.com/TravisPritchardODEQ/AWQMSdata_ShinyHelp)  


Note that this package is currently a work in progress. It is being developed by Travis Pritchard- pritchard.travis@deq.state.or.us

## Installation

**_You need an ODBC connection to the AWQMS database named AWQMS, and read access to VW_AWQMS_Results._**

You also need to have the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package installed. 
```
install.packages("devtools")
```

To install AWQMSdata:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("TravisPritchardODEQ/AWQMSdata")
```

## Usage

#### AWQMS_Data
Use `AWQMS_Data()` to retrieve data from Oregon DEQ AWQMS database. This dataset is too large to load into R, so you must include parameters to filter down the data. The default start date is 1949-09-15, which represents the earliest datapoint available in AWQMS. 

Note - There is a shiny app to help put together this function. The app helps by allowing you to select from lists of valid values. You can clone or download the app [here](https://github.com/TravisPritchardODEQ/AWQMSdata_ShinyHelp) and run locally on your machine.   

To retrieve all available data from 1/1/2017 - 12/31/2017:

```
data <- AWQMS_Data(startdate = '2017-01-01', enddate = '2017-12-31')
```

To retrieve all available data from 1/1/2017 - 12/31/2017 generated by Oregon DEQ
```
data <- AWQMS_Data(startdate = '2017-01-01', enddate = '2017-12-31', org = c('OREGONDEQ') )
```

To retrieve water temperature and dissolved oxygen data from 1/1/2017 - 12/31/2017 generated by Oregon DEQ:
```
data <- AWQMS_Data(startdate = '2017-01-01', enddate = '2017-12-31', char = c('Temperature, water', 'Dissolved oxygen (DO)') , org = c('OREGONDEQ') )
```

`AWQMS_Data()` defaults to removing QC data. Leaving `filterQC = TRUE` will remove data for site '10000-ORDEQ' and with activity_type that contains 'Quality Control'. To include the QC data:
```
data <- AWQMS_Data(startdate = '2017-01-01', enddate = '2017-12-31', char = c('Temperature, water', 'Dissolved oxygen (DO)') , org = c('OREGONDEQ') , filterQC = FALSE)
```


<br/>

#### AWQMS_Chars
Use `AWQMS_Chars()` to return available characteristics from AWQMS. Arguments can be project or station

To return all available characteristics in AWQMS:

```
characteristics <- AWQMS_Chars()
```

To return all available characteristics in the VolMon program: 

```
characteristics <- AWQMS_Chars(project = 'ODEQVolMonWQProgram')
```

To return all available characteristics for Volmon and Continuous Water Quality Monitoring:

```
characteristics <- AWQMS_Chars(project = c('ODEQVolMonWQProgram', 'Continuous Water Quality Monitoring'))
```

<br/>

#### AWQMS_Projects
Use `AWQMS_Projects()` to return all available projects from AWQMS. This function will include projects found in the Project1, Project2, and Project3 fields. This function doesn't take any arguments.  

```
projects <- AWQMS_Projects()
```

A vector of projects can be then created.

```
projects_vector <- projects$Project
```

<br/>  


#### AWQMS_Stations
Use `AWQMS_Stations()` to return available stations from AWQMS. This function's arguments can include any or all of vectors of project, characteristics, HUC8, HUC8 name, or organization.  

To see all available stations:
```
stations <- AWQMS_Stations()
```

To see stations that are associated with Oregon DEQ:
```
stations <- AWQMS_Stations(org = 'OREGONDEQ')
```

To see stations with water temperature and dissolved oxygen data:

```
stations <- AWQMS_Stations(char = c('Temperature, water', 'Dissolved oxygen (DO)'))
```

To see stations with water temperature and dissolved oxygen data in the Middle Fork John Day:

```
stations <- AWQMS_Stations(char = c('Temperature, water', 'Dissolved oxygen (DO)'), HUC8 = '17070203')
```

For all the functions in this package, the arguments can be a single parameter or a vector of parameters. For example, to see stations with water temperature and dissolved oxygen data in the Middle Fork John Day, and the Lower John Day :

```
stations <- AWQMS_Stations(char = c('Temperature, water', 'Dissolved oxygen (DO)'), HUC8 = c('17070203', '17070204'))
```

<br/>

#### AWQMS_Orgs
Use `AWQMS_Orgs()` to return available organizations from AWQMS.  This function's arguments can include vectors of project or stations.  

To return all available organizations in AWQMS:

```
organizations <- AWQMS_Orgs()
```

To return all available organizations that have water temperature and dissolved oxygen data for the Middle and Lower John Day:

```
> stations <- AWQMS_Stations(char = c('Temperature, water', 'Dissolved oxygen (DO)'), HUC8_Name = c('Middle Fork John Day', 'Lower John Day'))  
> stations_vector <- stations$MLocID  
> organizations <- AWQMS_Orgs(station = stations_vector)  
```
